# nvim-lua
This is my private neovim config.

## Special about this config
Here is a list of things special about this config which can't be found in many other configs:
+ Ultra fast load times when opening files: 55ms
    + [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/nvchad) has 120ms when opening files
+ No status column (no line numbers)
+ No snippet plugin (uses `vim.snippet`) (still has cmp)
+ [small.nvim](https://github.com/altermo/small.nvim): my collection of private plugins
+ Uses [pckr.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/pckr.nvim) as package manager
+ Conceal specific keywords in lua
+ Nushell highlighting
