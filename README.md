# nvim-lua
This is my private neovim config.

## Special about this config
Here is a list of things special about this config which can't be found in many other configs:
+ Ultra fast load times when opening files: 85ms
    + [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/nvchad) has 120ms when opening files
+ No status column (no line numbers)
+ No snippet plugin (still has cmp)
+ `small.nvim`: my collection of private plugins
+ Conceal specific keywords in lua
+ Nushell highlighting
